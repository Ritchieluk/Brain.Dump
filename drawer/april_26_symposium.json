  "Source Text": "I need to write an example journal for the symposium. Gotta be honest, that makes me anxious. If I had to guess, the affect values for this piece will be anxiety-caused fear. I'm upset I'm not watching Avengers Endgame, but happy because this project is a passion of mine. If anyone spoils the movie for I will be thoroughly angry. Only 3 more days of class is causing my anticipation for the summer to rise. Paris is going to be so much fun! I'm disappointed we won't be singing in Notre Dame, but nevertheless I know it will be a memorable trip. Okay I think this is a sufficient length. I wonder if anyone will be able to read this far? Maybe. Hope this works. I'd be sad if it didn't."
